# Attic Cybersecurity AI Assistant POC

This is a proof of concept for an AI assistant that can help with cybersecurity incident response. It is built with Azure Functions, Azure Table Storage, and OpenAI. The implementation is specific to the atticsecurity.com platform, but it could be adapted to other systems with some modification. Use our project as a inspiration for your own AI assistant.
